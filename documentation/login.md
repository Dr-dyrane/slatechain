### **Login Flow**

#### **1. User Enters Credentials**
- **Username/Email/Phone Number**: The user enters their registered **username**, **email**, or **phone number** (based on your app's configuration).
- **Password**: The user enters their password.

#### **2. Authentication Request**
- The credentials are sent to the backend API for authentication.
  - **Backend validates the user credentials** (email/phone + password combination).
  - If valid, a **JWT token** is generated and sent back as the response.
  - **Token**: The token is used to authenticate further API calls.
  - If invalid, an error message is returned (e.g., "Invalid credentials").

#### **3. Verification (Optional: 2FA)**
- If Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is enabled, the user is prompted to enter a **verification code** sent to their **email** or **phone number**.
- Once 2FA is successfully completed, the user is authenticated.

#### **4. Redirect or Dashboard Access**
- Upon successful login, the user is redirected to their appropriate dashboard based on their **role**:
  - **Customer**: Customer dashboard.
  - **Manager**: Manager dashboard.
  - **Supplier**: Supplier dashboard.
  - **Admin**: Admin dashboard.

#### **5. Token Storage**
- After successful login, the backend response includes a **JWT token** and possibly a **refresh token**.
- These tokens are stored locally (usually in **cookies** or **localStorage**) for maintaining the session.

#### **6. Session Expiry (Optional)**
- **Token Expiry**: If the token expires, the user needs to be redirected to the login page.
  - **Refresh Token**: If using a refresh token, an automatic request can be made to refresh the session without requiring the user to log in again.

#### **7. Error Handling**
- If there is an authentication error (e.g., incorrect password, expired token, etc.), the user will be notified and prompted to retry.
- If the login is successful, the app provides access to the appropriate resources.

### **Simplified Steps:**

1. **User enters login details (email/phone and password)**.
2. **Backend checks credentials and generates a token**.
3. If enabled, **2FA verification is requested**.
4. **Redirect to the appropriate dashboard** based on the user role.
5. **Tokens are stored** for maintaining session state.
6. Handle **session expiration** via a refresh mechanism (optional).

### **Key Points:**
- **Role-Based Access**: After logging in, the system checks the user's role and determines what dashboard or section to display.
- **Security**: You can implement additional layers like 2FA, especially for **admins** or **managers**, to enhance security.
- **Session Management**: Tokens are used to maintain the user session, with the option to refresh the token when it expires.

Overall, the **login flow** is straightforward compared to registration but can have additional complexities like 2FA or session expiration handling based on security needs.
