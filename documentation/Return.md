## üì¶ Return Management Document - Slatechain

This document outlines the data model design, UI flows, and business rules for implementing a **return management system** within the Slatechain ecosystem. The primary objective is to **reuse and extend existing models** wherever possible, while ensuring a **streamlined, traceable, and scalable return process**.

---

### üß† **Guiding Principles**

1. **Reusability:** Extend existing Slatechain data models to minimize code duplication and maintain consistency.  
2. **Simplicity:** Design the system to be straightforward for both customers and Slatechain staff.  
3. **Traceability:** Maintain a clear audit trail of all actions taken during the return process.  
4. **Flexibility:** Accommodate different types of returns (refunds, replacements, store credit, exchanges) and scenarios (e.g., damaged goods, wrong item shipped).  
5. **Scalability:** Design for future growth and integration with other Slatechain modules.

### üóÉÔ∏è **Data Model Modifications**

#### **1. Existing Slatechain Models**

##### **A. Order**
- **Objective:** Track order eligibility for returns and link to related return requests.  
- **Proposed Changes:**  
  - `is_returnable` (boolean, default: `true`): Indicates whether the order is eligible for returns.  
  - `return_window_end_date` (Date, nullable): The last date a return can be requested.  

---

##### **B. Order Item**
- **Objective:** Track the number of units returned for each item.  
- **Proposed Changes:**  
  - `quantity_returned` (integer, default: 0): Number of units returned for this item.  

---

##### **C. Inventory Item**
- **Objective:** Track the status of inventory.  
- **Proposed Changes:**  
  - `inventory_status` (enum):  
    - `Available`, `Reserved`, `InTransit`, `ReturnedAwaitingInspection`, `ReturnedGoodCondition`, `ReturnedDamaged`, `Quarantined`, `Disposed`, `ReturnToSender`.  

---

##### **D. Shipment**
- **Objective:** Track both inbound return shipments and outbound replacement shipments.  
- **Proposed Changes:**  
  - `relatedID` (text): Identifies whether it‚Äôs an order or a replacement.  
  - `refType` (enum): `Replacements`, `Order`.  

---

#### **2. New Slatechain Models**

##### **A. Return Request**
- **Objective:** Represent a customer's request to return items.  
- **Fields:**  
  - `return_request_id` (UUID): Unique identifier.  
  - `order_id` (FK): Links to the original purchase.  
  - `customer_id` (FK): User requesting the return.  
  - `request_date` (timestamp): Date of request.  
  - `return_reason` (enum): `Damaged`, `WrongItem`, `DoesNotFit`, `ChangedMind`, `Other`.  
  - `proofImages[]` (text): URLs linking to proof images or documents.  
  - `return_type` (enum): `Refund`, `Replacement`, `StoreCredit`, `Exchange`.  
  - `reviewed_by` (string): Staff or user ID reviewing the request.  
  - `updated_at`, `created_at` (timestamp): Timestamps for changes and creation.  

---

##### **B. Return Item**
- **Objective:** Track each item being returned.  
- **Fields:**  
  - `return_item_id` (UUID): Unique ID for the returned item.  
  - `return_request_id` (FK): Links to the parent return request.  
  - `order_item_id` (FK): Links to the original order item.  
  - `product_id` (FK): Links to the product.  
  - `quantity_requested` (integer): Number of units being returned.  
  - `quantity_received` (integer, nullable): Units actually received.  
  - `item_condition` (enum): `New`, `LikeNew`, `UsedGood`, `UsedFair`, `DamagedBeyondRepair`, `MissingParts`.  
  - `disposition` (enum): `Restock`, `Dispose`, `Quarantine`, `ReturnToSender`.  
  - `shipping_tracking_number` (string, nullable): Return shipment tracking number.  

---

##### **C. Resolution**
- **Objective:** Track the resolution of return requests.  
- **Fields:**  
  - `resolution_id` (UUID): Unique ID for the resolution.  
  - `return_request_id` (FK): Link to the parent return request.  
  - `status` (enum): `Pending`, `Processing`, `Completed`.  
  - `resolution_type` (enum): `Refund`, `Replacement`, `StoreCredit`, `Exchange`.  
  - `refund_id` (FK, nullable): Link to a refund record, if applicable.  
  - `status_code` (string): Reason for approval or rejection.

### üöÄ **UI Flows**

#### **1. Customer-Initiated Return**
1. Visit order history and select an eligible order.  
2. Click **"Return Items"** and choose items for return.  
3. Specify quantity, return reason, and upload proof images.  
4. Confirm refund or replacement options.  
5. Submit the request for review.  

---

#### **2. Staff Return Management Interface**
1. View all return requests with filtering and sorting options.  
2. Select a return request and review details.  
3. Update shipping and inventory status.  
4. Select a resolution type and finalize the decision.  

---

### üìù **Business Rules**

#### **Return Eligibility**
- Verify order eligibility before processing a return.  
- Check if the return window has expired.  

#### **Resolution Handling**
- Ensure the selected resolution is appropriate and feasible.  
- Update inventory based on return disposition.  

#### **Shipping Handling**

### User Roles and Permissions
The system defines four user roles: Customer, Supplier, Manager, and Admin. Each role has specific permissions related to return management.

#### Roles and Permissions Table
| Role      | Can Initiate Return | Can Process/Accept Return | Can View All Returns |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Customer | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚ùå No                     | ‚úÖ (Own Returns Only) |
| Supplier | ‚ùå No                | ‚ùå No                     | ‚úÖ (Related Returns)  |
| Manager  | ‚ùå No                | ‚úÖ Yes                     | ‚úÖ (All Returns)       |
