## SupplyCycles Integration Strategy: Phase 1 - Read-Only Data Visualization

**Introduction:**

This document outlines a phased approach to integrating external systems with SupplyCycles. Phase 1 focuses on read-only integrations for data visualization in the front-end, providing immediate value to users by bringing key information from external systems directly into the SupplyCycles interface. This approach minimizes initial complexity and risk, allowing for a gradual expansion of integration capabilities.

**Guiding Principles:**

*   **Start Small:** Focus on a single, high-value integration first.
*   **Prioritize Read-Only Access:** Begin by displaying data from external systems without enabling write operations (data modification) from within SupplyCycles.
*   **Abstraction and Reusability:** Encapsulate API calls and data transformations in reusable services.
*   **Security First:** Store API keys and secrets securely and implement proper authorization.
*   **User Feedback:** Provide clear loading indicators and error messages to the user.
*   **Respect Rate Limits:** Implement throttling or caching to avoid exceeding API rate limits.

**Phase 1: Read-Only Data Visualization**

**1. Identify a Use Case:**

*   Select the integration that provides the most immediate and impactful value to SupplyCycles users. Examples:
    *   **E-commerce Platform Integration (Shopify):** Display recent order data (customer name, order date, total amount, status) directly in the SupplyCycles dashboard.
    *   **BI and Analytics Tool Integration (Power BI):** Show key performance indicators (KPIs) from a Power BI dashboard (e.g., total revenue, order fulfillment rate) within SupplyCycles.
    *   **CRM System Integration (Salesforce):** Display customer-related information (e.g., recent activities, support tickets) within SupplyCycles's customer management section.

**2. Choose an Integration Method:**

*   Determine the appropriate method for accessing data from the selected external system:
    *   **REST API:** Most common and flexible approach. Utilizes standard HTTP requests to retrieve data.
    *   **Direct Database Connection (If Allowed):** In some cases, the external system might allow a direct read-only connection to its database. This can be simpler than using an API, but security concerns must be carefully addressed.
    *   **File Import:** If a direct connection isn't possible, consider a scheduled file import (e.g., CSV, Excel) from the external system. This is generally a last resort due to its manual nature and potential for data inconsistencies.

**3. Fetch and Transform Data:**

*   Create a dedicated service within your `src/lib/services` directory to handle data retrieval and transformation. This service should:
    *   Authenticate with the external system (if necessary).
    *   Make API calls to retrieve the relevant data.
    *   Transform the data into a consistent and easily consumable format for SupplyCycles components.
*   **Example (Shopify):**

    ```typescript
    // src/lib/services/shopifyService.ts
    import axios from 'axios';

    const SHOPIFY_API_URL = process.env.SHOPIFY_API_URL; // Read from environment variables
    const SHOPIFY_API_KEY = process.env.SHOPIFY_API_KEY; // Read from environment variables

    export const fetchRecentShopifyOrders = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(`${SHOPIFY_API_URL}/admin/api/2023-10/orders.json`, {
          headers: {
            'X-Shopify-Access-Token': SHOPIFY_API_KEY,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          params: {
            limit: 10, // Fetch the 10 most recent orders
          },
        });
        return response.data.orders; //  Array of order objects
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching Shopify orders:", error);
        return [];
      }
    };
    ```

**4. Display the Data:**

*   Modify existing SupplyCycles components or create new ones to display the fetched and transformed data. Use UI components and display logic to present data to make it accessible to the user.

**5. Handle Authentication and Authorization:**

*   Implement a secure method for authenticating with the external system and authorizing access to data. Use credentials management tools or a vault to store sensitive information. Store API keys and other secrets in environment variables, not directly in the code.
